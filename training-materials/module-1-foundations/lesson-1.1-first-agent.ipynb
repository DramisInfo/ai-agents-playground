    "## 🎯 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agents vs. Simple LLM Calls**: Agents have memory, can use tools, and maintain context\n",
    "2. **ChatAgent Components**: \n",
    "   - `chat_client`: The LLM backend\n",
    "   - `instructions`: System-level behavior guidance\n",
    "   - `name` and `description`: Identity and purpose\n",
    "3. **Instructions Matter**: Well-crafted instructions significantly impact agent behavior\n",
    "4. **Microsoft Agent Framework**: Provides a production-ready foundation for building agents\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "You're ready for **Exercise 1.1**! You'll apply what you've learned to:\n",
