## Summary
Automation Workflows let you automate repetitive tasks such as follow-ups, lead routing, and task creation using triggers and actions.

## Creating a Workflow
1. Navigate to **Automation → Workflows**
2. Click **"Create Workflow"**
3. Define a trigger (e.g., "New contact created", "Deal stage changed")
4. Add conditions and actions (send email, create task, update field)
5. Test the workflow and enable it

## Common Triggers
- New contact created
- Contact opens email
- Deal moves to a stage
- Custom webhook trigger

## Actions

- Create task or reminder
- Update contact/deal fields
- Call external webhook

## Testing & Monitoring

- Monitor execution history for failures and retries.

## Best Practices
- Keep workflows simple and modular.
